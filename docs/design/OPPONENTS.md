# OPPONENTS
## Purpose
Catalog opponent archetypes and behaviors.
## Philosophy & Design Rules
- Every opponent is a paddle with a unique ability that changes rally dynamics.
- Opponents should have memorable names, themed abilities, and distinct personalities.
- Beating a major opponent unlocks new, more powerful card types for the upgrade pool.
## Canon
- Named paddles with unique mechanics and personalities.
- Examples: Mirror Paddle (copies your upgrades), Kamaleon (invisible except on hit), Octopus (four mini-paddles).
## Drop Rules
- Beating a new major opponent unlocks stronger card types for future drafts.
