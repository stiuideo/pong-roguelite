# GAME DESIGN OVERVIEW
## Purpose
One-page map of the game vision, pillars, win/lose conditions, meta-progression philosophy, and links to detailed design docs.
## Pillars
- Pong Core, Roguelite Spice
- High readabilty, escalating chaos
- Meaningful trade-offs over raw power
## Canon
- Run-based structure with meta-progression (roguelite, not roguelike)
- Every match = arena + opponent + ball modifier
- 3-card draft after matches; cards include trade-offs and cosmetic changes
