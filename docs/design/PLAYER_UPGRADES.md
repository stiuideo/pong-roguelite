# PLAYER & UPGRADES
## Purpose
Define paddle identity and upgrade systems.
## Canon
- 3-card upgrade draft after matches; each card has a trade-off and a visual change.
- Example trade-offs: “+10% speed, -1 length”; “Magnetize ball to your Y-axis; -10% paddle length.”
## Visual Rules
- Each upgrade must alter the paddle/ball look subtly but clearly.
