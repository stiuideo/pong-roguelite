# CORE GAME LOOP & STRUCTURE
## Purpose
Define a single run, match flow, and progression triggers.
## Canon
- Loop: Lobby → Match(Arena+Opponent+Ball Mod) → Reward (3-card draft) → Next Match → … → Boss/Final → Death or Victory → Meta Hub.
- Permadeath with knowledge retention; certain deaths unlock new dialog lines or card pools.
