# STORY & LORE

## Purpose
Define the setting, tone, narrative beats, and hidden truth behind the game's world.

---

## Canon

### Setting
- **The World:** A vast, lightless void inhabited only by paddles.  
- **Daily Life:** Paddles can only communicate through short text messages, but conversations are shallow and repetitive.  
- **The Great Pong Championship:** The sole purpose of existence. Happens every day. All paddles fight until only one remains.

### The Legend
- **Losers:** Return to the void until the next Championship.  
- **Winners:** Enter **The Room** — a mysterious, glorious place. No one has ever returned.  
- **Cultural Belief:** The Room is so perfect that winners never want to come back.

### Player Role
- You are a young, naïve paddle who believes the legend and enters the Championship for glory.

## Spoilers

> **SPOILER: Reveal only after the player wins the Championship**

- **Reality:** The void-world is just a command-line terminal interface.  
- **Truth:** You are not alive — you are a paddle AI running on a **Magnavox Odyssey** console.  
- **The Room:** Simply the TV screen where matches against human players occur.  
- **Reason No One Returns:** When the store closes, the owner turns off the console. Any paddle AI in The Room is erased instantly.  
- **Twist Tone:** The glory you chased was simply a slot in the rotation to amuse kids for a day.

---

## Spoiler Handling Guidelines
- Do not hint at the Magnavox Odyssey or AI nature in early-game dialog.
- Maintain mystery about The Room until the final victory sequence.
- Use small environmental clues in late arenas (e.g., glitchy text, faint outlines of screen edges) to foreshadow the truth subtly.

## Narrative Pillars
1. **Absurd but Deadpan:** Treat the paddle society as if it were a real culture, with traditions and myths.
2. **High Stakes from Low Stakes:** Build drama around a game of Pong as though it were a grand sport.
3. **Darkly Comedic Twist:** Winning is not transcendence, but oblivion.
