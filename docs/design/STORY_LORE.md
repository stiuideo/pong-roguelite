# STORY & LORE
## Purpose
Define the setting, tone, and the hidden truth.
## Canon
- You are a paddle in a void-world of paddles; daily Great Pong Championship decides who enters “The Room.”
- Spoiler: The world is a terminal; you are an AI paddle on a Magnavox Odyssey. “The Room” is the TV screen; no one returns because power is cut.
## Spoilers Handling
- Keep spoiler content gated by build flags or late-game reveals; never surface in tutorial copy.
